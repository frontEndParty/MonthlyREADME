`For 20 years, programming the web browser required JavaScript. But today, you can run code from almost all programming languages in your browser, via WebAssembly! WebAssembly (aka WASM) is a tiny, secure VM supported by all browsers, which can run code from most other languages. This means you can reuse libraries written in Rust, Python, C++, Go -- almost anything -- in your browsers without needing to rewrite them in JavaScript.`

`In this workshop we're going to progressively enhance a JavaScript app with Rust code via WebAssembly. You'll learn how to use key tools to compile Rust code into WebAssembly, how to pass data between JS and Rust, and how to add super-fast Rust libraries to your JavaScript to speed up critical parts of your apps.`

## :computer: INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:computer:  

1. Install wasm:  
https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/

2. Install rust:  
https://rustup.rs/

3. Then:  
`rustup install stable`   
`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

4. If you want to get Rust IDE support, VSCode has a straightforward extension "rust-analyzer" that works great, but for other IDEs you'll need to install rust-analyzer yourself. It's available through homebrew for MacOS.
